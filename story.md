# Welcome To The Bass Station

You've heard of this legendary interstellar traveller. A being bored by earthly existence. He took his trusty bass guitar and synths and ventured forth into the abyssal blackness of space to tap the cosmic core for sounds unheard.

You decided to follow his trail and found an old but still airtight space station left over from the Babylon program. Most of the exterior LEDs are dysfunctional, but you can clearly see someone rearranged them to spell "BASS STATION". You decided to dock.

You are in the dimly-lit entrance hall. Nobody sits at the greeting desk at the opposite end, yet a small desk radiates its warm incandescent light rays onto the computer keyboard. The tech has seen better days, but it appears functional. The fans hum their contemplative sigh.

You hear a distant rumbling emanating from the corridor on the right. All the while you notice a small stereo on the left, together with some vinyls and cassette tapes on a small shelf.
