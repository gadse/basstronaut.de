# Hi!

You have found the source code of my homepage. Maybe that's me from the future, who knows. After all, after three months, your own code reads like a foreigner's. :)

# Technical Stuff

I have forked and adapted this beautiful, slender theme here and made it my own: https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console

Just install your Ruby, Gem, and Jekyll dependencies and you are good to go!

```bash
bundle
jekyll build
jekyll serve
```
