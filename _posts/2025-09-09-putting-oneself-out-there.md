# Putting Oneself Out There

This is weird. I'm a trained engineer. With engineering stuff, I rarely ever have a problem with attaching my name and/or face to something I contributed to. Or made completely on my own. But with artistic things, I've always been hesitant.

The lack of good (or even best) practices is somewhat unsettling. But it's also what's so inspiring. What makes art... art. What draws me to it. I guess it's what stimulates most of us artists. There are so many paths already trod upon, but also a lot of ground still uncovered. And while the onslaught of Artificial Incompetence is still ongoing, it will inevitably produce more of what's already there.

So while I welcome our new AI overlords in certain aspects, I do it more for the things they will make us think about. For the heightened value of true authenticity. For a renewed awareness of lasting, enduring, sustainable value in this world.

This is why I decided to finally put myself out there. AI will never truly experience the joy of writing music that captures a certain essence of existence. Of making a mixing mistake at the turntables and turning it into inspiration.

When you listen to my works, while parts of it are programmed, like drums, synthesizers, or even some guitar parts, know that all decisions have been made by a human being. All mistakes have been thoroughly enjoyed and learned from. And that you connecting with the music, should I and my co-creators have achieved that, is filling us with pride.

If you want to connect with _us_, you'll find your method of choice in the [contact](/contact) overview.
