# Live Music Is Best Music

(links lead to external sites)

## Live Streams
You can also hear me <a class="hacky-button-twitch" href="https://www.twitch.tv/grizz_metal">live on Twitch</a> sometimes! There, I give _studio concerts_ (mainly metal covers on my bass), do _live DJ sets_ (again, mainly metal) and some other times I _play games_ like Battlefield. Follow me to get notified!

## Schedule
The best way to get notified of my schedule and changes thereof is <a class="hacky-button-discord" href="example.com">My Discord Server</a>. It's also the best way to get updates of songs and other projects in the making before release.

## DJ-Mixes
Some recordings of DJ sets can be found <a class="hacky-button-mixcloud" href="https://www.mixcloud.com/MetalGrizz">on Mixcloud</a>. Due to restrictions of Mixcloud, some mixes are not available. That can happen when I am particularly fond of a band's music and vibe on a given evening and exceed Mixcloud's song-per-band-per-set restriction.
