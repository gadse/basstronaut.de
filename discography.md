Stuff that has not been programmed but played or modulated live is _emphasized_. If you want to support me, the best way (at the moment) is to purchase my music on <a class="hacky-button-bandcamp" href="https://thebasstronaut.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> or <a class="hacky-button-apple" href="https://music.apple.com/de/artist/basstronaut/1592675229">Apple Music</a>. :) 

(I'm still in the process of collecting old works and adding them here.)

# [2025] Memory Card (Imaginary Game Soundtrack)

This album is 100% written, recorded, mixed, and mastered by me.

## [01] Onwards

{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/01 Onwards.mp3" %}

Dear Breathers and Gentlebeings, start your engines!

_Electric bass played by me._

## [02] Hyperlight Test Drive

{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/02 Hyperlight Test Drive.mp3" %}

Taking your spaceship out for a cruise? Tune in to this and your voyage will be smooth as heck!

## [03] Simple Tune

{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/03 Simple Tune.mp3" %}

A song about communication issues. Also about what happens when you send a cello through distortion.

_Electric bass played by me._

## [04] Prayer To The Mighty Mainframe

{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/04 Prayer To The Mighty Mainframe.mp3" %}

A song heavily inspired by the BattleTech universe -- a far future where technical understanding is gone and replaced by religious worship of the ancient technology that enables you to communicate over vast distances. If stuff breaks down, you're on your own. Many weeks of interstellar travel away from your next center of civilization. So: how would you feel when your precious tech dies out there?

There's also an artsy music video <a class="hacky-button-youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu3kdQiEpnU">on YouTube</a> because I had fun making one.

## [05] Defiance

{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/05 Defiance.mp3" %}

A song about not giving in when faced with adversity.

_Electric Guitar, main synth played live by me._


## [06] Hello Frank

{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/06 Hello Frank.mp3" %}

Intro to Tiberium. A display of my love for my favorite soundtrack works of Frank Klepacki. I never thought I'd mix a marching band into anything I do, but here it is. :D

## [07] Tiberium

{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/07 Tiberium.mp3" %}

Inspired by the Command & Conquer video game series and their Soundtracks by Frank Klepacki. Yes I dared an hommage to one of my musical heroes!

_Some synths recorded live through a Waldorf Streichfett, and modulated live._

## [08] Cyberware Beta

{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/08 Cyberware Beta.mp3" %}

Inspired by the game Cyberpunk 2077. The track "Spoiler" by Hyper is one of the game's most famous tracks and I thought it could do with some more metal! This is an early instrumental version from before I got the chance to get a guitarist and a vocalist on board.

_Bass Guitar played by me._

## [09] Conveyor Belts

{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/09 Conveyor Belts.mp3" %}

Inspired by the game Factorio.

_All except drums recorded through an Arturia MiniFreak and modulated live._

## [10] Lost In Thought

{% include embed-audio.html src="assets/audio/10 Lost In Thought.mp3" %}

Written in a sad moment. Yes, it has a sax solo. Some clich√©s are just meant to be adhered to.

_Electric bass played by me._
